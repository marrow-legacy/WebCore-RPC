An XML remote procedure call controller interface for WebCore.

HTTP is often used as a communication medium for a variety of dialects.  The WWW dialect (files over HTTP) is by far the most common and widely understood.  Others exist, including a number of RPC - remote procedure call - dialects that allow software systems to communicate with each other.  XML-RPC is an example of this; a flexible system with introspection features that uses large blocks of XML to pass messages between disparate systems.

A (mostly) proprietary RPC system, AMF, is a binary format used to communicate with ActionScript, Flex, and Flash, all products from Adobe.  It has the benefit of extreme performance.

Slightly less practical, as there is nothing will supports it except WebCore for now, is B-RPC.  It uses a modified Bencoding algorithm (the same algorithm used by Bittorrent to store metadata) and is more efficient than XML-RPC, but less efficient than AMF.
